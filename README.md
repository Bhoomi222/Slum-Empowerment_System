### Hello, I'm [BHOOMI] üëã

I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. Here's a glimpse of my work:

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects
- **Project 1**:The rapid urbanization and high population density in Mumbai have resulted in significant challenges, 
                including the proliferation of slums, inadequate transportation infrastructure, inefficient time management for commuters, and safety concerns. 
                Additionally, the lack of affordable housing exacerbates these issues, contributing to increased poverty, health risks, and mental health problems among residents. 
                Addressing these interconnected challenges requires a comprehensive approach to improve living conditions, enhance urban infrastructure, and ensure the well-being of the population.

**OVERVIEW:**

1. **Efficient Navigation**: Provide optimized, eco-friendly transportation using electric vehicles, bicycles, and shuttles, supported by real-time traffic and route updates.
2. **Resource Management**: Dynamically allocate transportation and maintenance resources using advanced algorithms for peak efficiency.
3. **Environmental Monitoring**: Deploy IoT sensors for real-time tracking of air and noise pollution, enabling proactive measures.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop accessible apps and dashboards for tourists, residents, and administrators for seamless interaction.

**Technical Stack:**

- **Languages**: C++, Java
- **Algorithms**: Dijkstra‚Äôs, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- **Tools**: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques

**Impact:**

1. **Environmental Preservation**: Reduces air and noise pollution to protect Matheran‚Äôs natural environment and biodiversity.
2. **Enhanced Mobility**: Offers eco-friendly, congestion-free transportation, improving accessibility for residents and tourists.
3. **Economic Boost**: Drives eco-tourism growth and optimizes resource use for cost-effective, sustainable development.
4. **Health and Lifestyle Benefits**: Promotes cleaner air, quieter surroundings, and active lifestyles through non-motorized transport.
5. **Global Benchmark for Sustainability**: Establishes Matheran as a leading example of eco-conscious urban planning and tourism.
